Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)

A hackathon project focused on building a smarter, data-driven way to manage urban traffic using real-time data, AI logic, and a modern web stack.

This project aims to simulate how intelligent traffic systems can reduce congestion, improve signal timing, and give city authorities better visibility into traffic flow using a simple, scalable software-based solution.

- Problem We’re Solving

Many cities still use fixed-time traffic signals that don’t adapt to real traffic conditions. This results in:

Long waiting times at traffic lights

Poor handling of rush hours and peak traffic

No real-time monitoring or predictive insights

Inefficient use of road capacity

Our goal is to simulate and demonstrate how traffic lights can become dynamic, data-driven, and optimized using AI and live data.

- What Our System Does

STMS provides a real-time dashboard to monitor, simulate, and optimize traffic at intersections.

Key Features

- Live traffic status per intersection (Low / Medium / High)

- Color-coded traffic indicators (Green, Yellow, Red)

- Real-time charts & traffic analytics

- AI-driven traffic prediction & signal timing optimization

- Traffic simulation for different scenarios (rush hour, accidents, delays)

- City/intersection view (map-based visualization planned)

- Alerts for heavy congestion zones

- Data export for analysis (CSV / Reports)

Optional future plans include integrating real IoT devices (Arduino / Raspberry Pi) instead of simulated data.
